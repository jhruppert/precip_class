# precip_class
This repository contains a modified version of WRF's RRTMG scheme "module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F" that includes a column-based precipitation classification algorithm as a switch for ICLOUD (to remove cloud interaction). That script is modified from WRFv4.3.1.

This repository also includes a Jupyter notebook and python function that demo this algorithm using 
a single time step of WRF model output.
