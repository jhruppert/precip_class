# precip_class
This repository contains a modified version of WRF's RRTMG scheme "module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F" that includes a column-based precipitation classification algorithm as a switch for ICLOUD (to remove cloud interaction). That script is modified from WRFv4.3.1.

This repository also includes a Jupyter notebook and python function that demo this algorithm using 
a single time step of WRF model output.

Coded by James Ruppert and Emily Luschen, University of Oklahoma.

**This algorithm has not yet been assessed via peer review, so caution is suggested in its use. A manuscript is now in preparation by the authors to review this work.**
